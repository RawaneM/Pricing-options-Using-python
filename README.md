# Pricing-options-Using-python
In this depository you have :
- 2 ways to build your cumulative distribution function using python
- 3 pricing models (Black&Scholes, Montecarlo, Heston)
- A function that extract implied volatility using Newton's method
- Functions that heps compute greeks using finite difference method :
    - The fist one is a generalized algo where you can derive with respect to a variable at the desired order.
    - The second just returns main greeks
- A function that use previous functions to return price and greeks, you can choose the model.
