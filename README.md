# Pricing-options-Using-python
In this depository you have :
- 2 ways to build a cumulative distribution function (CDF) using python;
- 3 pricing models (Black&Scholes, Montecarlo, Heston);
- A function that extract implied volatility using Newton's method;
- 2 functions that help compute greeks using the finite difference method :
The first one is a generalised algorithm where you can derive the option price with respect to a variable at the desired order.
The second function just returns main greeks in an elegant data-frame;
- A function that uses the previous functions to price your option and return greeks (the user need to specify the pricing model).
